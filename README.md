# Exploratory Data Analysis - King County Housing Data

This repository contains a EDA on the King County Housing Data Set.
## Introduction

The purpose of this EDA is to find insights into the King County House Market, by analyzing the data in regards to three hypotheses, which we either confirm or discard during this EDA.
